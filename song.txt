The only thing that's certain in this life
You don't wanna skip the queue
'Cause you only get one, right?

And no-one can control the cards they're dealt
But you can learn to play the game
Like nobody else

And though, I know the days are tough
But these are the nights we'll be talking of

When your glass is half empty
Let your heart be full and true
When the world tries to change you
You know what you should do

This ain't a dress rehearsal
So when life comes for you
Say 'screw it, I can do it'
And raise a glass
To being you

'Cause no-one else will do
So here's a glass to you
'Cause no-one else will do (here's a glass to you)

You've got to be true to who's inside
Even when it means that you swim against the tide
Let's raise a glass to everyone who does
All those here among us
'Cause they're the ones we love

And though, I know the days are tough
But these are the times we'll be talking of

When your glass is half empty
Let your heart be full and true
When the world tries to change you
You know what you should do

This ain't a dress rehearsal
So when life comes for you
Say 'screw it, I can do it'
And raise a glass
To being you

'Cause no-one else will do
So here's a glass to you
'Cause no-one else will do (here's a glass to you)

You've got to be true to who's inside
Even when it means that you swim against the tide
Let's raise a glass to everyone who does
All those here among us
'Cause they're the ones we love

And though, I know the days are tough
But these are the times we'll be talking of

When your glass is half empty
Let your heart be full and true
When the world tries to change you
You know what you should do

This ain't a dress rehearsal
So when life comes for you
Say 'screw it, I can do it'
And raise a glass
To being you

'Cause no-one else will do
So here's to being to you
'Cause no-one else will do (here's a glass to you)

When your glass is half empty
Let your heart be full and true
When the world tries to change you
You know what you should do

This ain't a dress rehearsal
So when life comes for you
Say 'screw it, I can do it'
And raise a glass
To being you

'Cause no-one else will do
So here's to being you
